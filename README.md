# To-the-end-Math-game
I made this game for my younger sisters,the game is made using html, css, javascript and bootstrap.The basic rule is whoever solves the given problems first and reaches the level which is set, will win the game.The problems are generated randomly and progress of both the players is noted and level is increased if the player solves the given problem correctly if the answer given by the player is wrong then the status of wrong answer is shown.
